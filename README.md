## Zephyr Air

### About
Zephyr Air is a group of 4  first-year graduate students from the Global Innovation Exchange program at the University of Washington. Even though we only met each other just a few months ago, we immediately connected over our passion for technology, and the benefits it can bring to people. The team is comprised of Dongbin Bai, Thomas Shen, Yue Yu, and Qian Zhao. Due to COVID-19, our team members were unexpectedly forced to communicate remotely across timezones. However, these challenges have motivated us to reevaluate even the smallest things in our lives and how technology can improve them. Fortunately, we have two advisers to guide us on the way to entering Imagine Cup, John Raiti and Julian Marshall. John Raiti is an assistant teaching professor at the Global Innovation Exchange program; he brought his profound knowledge in robotics and connected us with our second advisor. Julian Marshall is the John R. Kiely Endowed Professor In the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington. Being a subject matter expert, Professor Marshall offered his knowledge and impressed upon us the significance of having a healthy indoor air quality and taught us which critical factors to measure it with. Combining their professional knowledge and experiences, we are able to translate our initial ideas into a tangible product.
